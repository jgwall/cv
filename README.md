# Curriculum Vitae for Dr. Jason G. Wallace

This is the CV for Dr. Jason Wallace at the University of Georgia. This is currently under development, but will hopefully be brought up to speed over the next few weeks (=Spring 2022).

This CV is made using the [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) package for R, and makes use of the baretable() fuction from [Rob Hyndman's CV](https://github.com/robjhyndman/CV).
