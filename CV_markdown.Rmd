# TODO: Various ways I can tweak this. I like the direct format of https://github.com/robjhyndman/CV/ , but it involves typing stuff right into the rMarkdown. Like use of custom baretable() function to make a no-nonsense table for output. Adapt?
# TODO: Can also use Bookdown to separate out sections. Not necessary as currently written, but would help if want to include plaint-text stuff somewhere.
